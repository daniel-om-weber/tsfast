    "\n",
    "1. **Diagnosis** (first `init_sz` timesteps): the model processes the\n",
    "   initialization window -- both input u(t) and measured output y(t-1) -- to\n",
    "   estimate the system's current internal state from measurement data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prognosis** (remaining timesteps): using the estimated state from diagnosis\n",
    "   as initial hidden state, the model predicts forward using only the input u(t).\n",
    "   During training, the prognosis module sees the full sequence; during inference,\n",
    "   it runs autoregressively from the estimated state.\n",
    "\n",
